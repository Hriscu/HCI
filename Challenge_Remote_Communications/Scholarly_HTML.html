<h2>3. Introduction</h2>
<p>This report will present the progress of the "Remote Communications" challenge, carried out by the students Hriscu Alexandru-Gabriel and Cosmin Anton, during the second semester of the academic year 2022-2023, Faculty of Informatics Iasi. This report presents the answers to the problems presented previously for the following two remote communication applications: Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. </p>
<h2>4. Remote communication application - Google Meet</h2>
<p><b>Question 1. </b>Observe the existing affordances, visual variables and interaction flows for a given use case â€“ for example, delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at late hours â€“ and propose better approaches (if any).</p>
<p><b>Answer 1. </b>Let's consider the use case of delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at late hours in Google Meet.
    Existing affordances, visual variables, and interaction flows:</p>
<ol> 
     <li>Sharing screen: Google Meet provides the affordance of screen sharing, which allows the presenter to share their screen with the audience. The visual variable used for this affordance is a green icon with an upward arrow, which is located at the bottom of the screen. The interaction flow involves the presenter clicking on the icon and selecting the appropriate screen to share.</li>
     <li>Chat: Google Meet provides the affordance of chat, which allows participants to communicate with each other during the presentation/meeting. The visual variable used for this affordance is a speech bubble icon located at the bottom of the screen. The interaction flow involves the participant clicking on the icon and typing their message.</li>
     <li>Recording: Google Meet provides the affordance of recording, which allows the presenter to record the presentation/meeting. The visual variable used for this affordance is a red icon with a circle located at the bottom of the screen. The interaction flow involves the presenter clicking on the icon and selecting the option to record.</li>
</ol>
    <p>Proposed better approaches:</p>
   <ol>  
     <li>Screen sharing: While screen sharing is a useful affordance, it can be improved by allowing the presenter to choose which specific application or window to share instead of sharing their entire screen. This can be achieved by providing a dropdown menu with a list of currently open applications/windows for the presenter to choose from.</li>
     <li>Chat: The chat affordance can be improved by providing the option to send private messages to specific participants instead of just sending messages to the entire group. This can be achieved by allowing the participant to click on the name of the participant they wish to message and opening a private chat window.</li>
     <li>Recording: While recording is a useful affordance, it can be improved by providing the option to automatically transcribe the recording. This can be achieved by using AI technology to transcribe the audio of the recording and provide a text-based version of the presentation/meeting.</li>
  </ol>  
    <p>Overall, by providing these proposed better approaches, Google Meet can enhance the user experience for delivering academic presentations or attending meetings at late hours.</p>

<p><b>Question 2. </b>Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest the similar ones for a text-only interaction (see CLI â€“ Command Line Interface).</p>
<p><b>Answer 2. </b>Google Meet relies heavily on visual metaphors and idioms to convey information and functionality to users. For example, the "hand raise" icon or the "mute/unmute" button are visual metaphors that are easily recognizable and intuitive for users. However, when it comes to text-only interactions, such as a Command Line Interface (CLI), visual metaphors and idioms are not applicable. Instead, text-based idioms and language are used to convey functionality and commands.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of visual metaphors and idioms used in Google Meet and similar ones that can be used in a CLI:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>
	<ul>
	<li>Visual Metaphor: Hand raise icon</li>
    <li>Text-based Idiom: "Request permission to speak"</li>
    <li>In a CLI, a user can use a command such as "request permission to speak" to indicate they want to speak or ask a question. This can be achieved by implementing a feature that allows users to "raise their hand" using a specific command or keyword.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<br>
    <li>
	<ul>
	<li>Visual Metaphor: Mute/unmute button</li>
   <li>Text-based Idiom: "Toggle mute on/off" </li>
    <li>In a CLI, a user can use a command such as "toggle mute on/off" to mute or unmute their microphone. This can be achieved by implementing a feature that allows users to use a specific command or keyword to mute or unmute their microphone.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<ul>
    <li>Visual Metaphor: Share screen icon</li>
    <li>Text-based Idiom: "Share screen with remote participants"</li>
    <li>In a CLI, a user can use a command such as "share screen with remote participants" to share their screen during a call. This can be achieved by implementing a feature that allows users to use a specific command or keyword to share their screen with other participants.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
  </ol>
    <p>Overall, while visual metaphors and idioms are not applicable in a text-only interaction such as a CLI, text-based idioms and language can be used to convey functionality and commands in a similar way. By implementing features that allow users to use specific commands or keywords, a CLI can be just as intuitive and easy to use as a visual interface like Google Meet.</p>

<p><b>Question 3. </b>Discuss the cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts.</p>
<p><b>Answer 3. </b>Cognitive overload occurs when a person's working memory is overwhelmed by too much information or too many tasks, leading to decreased performance and increased stress levels. In the context of Google Meet, cognitive overload can occur in several situations, including:

    Large group meetings: In large group meetings, participants may find it difficult to keep track of multiple speakers and discussions simultaneously. This can lead to cognitive overload as the brain struggles to process and remember all the information.
    
    Multitasking: During a Google Meet call, participants may also be multitasking, such as checking emails or working on other tasks while still participating in the call. This can lead to cognitive overload as the brain tries to switch between different tasks, leading to decreased performance in all tasks.
    
    Technical difficulties: Technical difficulties such as poor network connectivity or video/audio issues can also contribute to cognitive overload, as participants may struggle to hear or see what is happening in the call, leading to increased stress levels.
    
    To mitigate cognitive overload in these special conditions/contexts, Google Meet can take several steps, such as:
    
    Limiting the number of participants in a call: To reduce cognitive overload in large group meetings, Google Meet can limit the number of participants in a call or introduce features such as breakout rooms to allow for smaller group discussions.
    
    Encouraging focused attention: Google Meet can encourage participants to focus their attention on the call and limit multitasking by providing guidance on best practices and reminders to turn off distractions such as notifications or other tabs.
    
    Providing technical support: Google Meet can provide technical support to participants to reduce technical difficulties and prevent cognitive overload. This can include providing guidance on how to improve network connectivity or troubleshooting common video/audio issues.
    
    Overall, reducing cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts can improve the user experience and increase productivity in Google Meet calls.</p>
<p><b>Question 4. </b>List minimum three improvements that can be made to optimize these applications from the point of view of the main audience on at least two platforms â€“ for instance, Web + mobile native, desktop native + mobile native. Each improvement will be listed in pairs: UI/UX problem identified & solution suggested.</p>
<p><b>Answer 4. </b>Here are three improvements that can optimize Google Meet from the point of view of the main audience on two platforms:

    Web + Mobile Native:
    
    UI/UX Problem: Inconsistent user interface and functionality across different devices and platforms can cause confusion and frustration for users.
    Solution: Design a consistent user interface and functionality across all devices and platforms. The user interface should be easy to navigate, and the same features and functionalities should be available on all devices and platforms. This will make it easier for users to switch between devices and use the platform seamlessly.
    Desktop Native + Mobile Native:
    
    UI/UX Problem: It can be challenging to manage multiple participants during a video call, especially on mobile devices with smaller screens.
    Solution: Introduce a feature that allows users to manage participants easily on both desktop and mobile devices. This feature can include functionalities such as muting participants, enabling and disabling video, and removing participants. It can also include a feature that allows the moderator to control the call from their device while allowing participants to use their own devices to view and listen.
    Web + Mobile Native:
    
    UI/UX Problem: Poor video and audio quality can negatively impact the user experience and make it difficult to communicate effectively during a call.
    Solution: Improve the video and audio quality on both web and mobile devices. This can include optimizing video and audio compression algorithms, improving network connectivity, and introducing a feature that allows users to adjust video and audio quality based on their network conditions. Additionally, Google Meet can also provide guidance to users on how to improve their video and audio quality, such as suggesting the use of headphones or providing tips on network connectivity.</p>
<p><b>Question 5. </b>How the empiric laws (Fittsâ€™, Hickâ€™s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device interaction?</p>
<p><b>Answer 5. </b>The empiric laws of Fitts', Hick's, and Steering can be reconsidered and adapted in the context of multi-device interaction in Google Meet as follows:

    Fitts' Law: Fitts' Law states that the time required to move a pointer to a target is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. In the context of multi-device interaction, this law can be adapted to account for the differences in the size and location of targets on different devices. For example, if a user is using a smartphone and a laptop simultaneously during a Google Meet call, the targets (such as buttons or links) on each device will be different in size and location. To accommodate this, the user interface can be designed to optimize the placement of targets on each device based on the device's screen size and orientation.
    
    Hick's Law: Hick's Law states that the time required to make a decision increases with the number of choices. In the context of multi-device interaction, this law can be adapted to account for the number of devices being used simultaneously. For example, if a user is using multiple devices during a Google Meet call, they may need to switch between devices to perform different tasks. To minimize the time required to make decisions, the user interface can be designed to provide clear and intuitive navigation between devices.
    
    Steering Law: The Steering Law states that the time required to move a pointer to a target is a function of the angle between the pointer and the target. In the context of multi-device interaction, this law can be adapted to account for the different angles and orientations of different devices. For example, if a user is using a smartphone and a laptop during a Google Meet call, the orientation of the devices may be different, and the user may need to adjust their movement to match the angle of the device. To accommodate this, the user interface can be designed to provide consistent and intuitive movement between devices, regardless of their orientation.</p>
<p><b>Question 6. </b>List three new features that can be added to improve the experience and sketch those new features on paper and/or digitally.</p>
<p><b>Answer 6. </b>Virtual Backgrounds: Google Meet should introduce a feature that allows users to change their backgrounds to a virtual image or video during a video call. This feature has already been introduced in other video conferencing apps and has become popular. It can help users maintain their privacy by hiding their actual location, and it can also add a fun element to video calls.

    Live Polls: Adding live polls during a Google Meet call can be a great way to engage participants and collect feedback from them. This feature can be useful for conducting surveys or gathering opinions on various topics discussed during the call. This feature can also provide real-time results, which can help in decision-making processes.
    
    Breakout Rooms: Google Meet should add the ability to create breakout rooms during a video call. This feature can be useful in group discussions where participants can be divided into smaller groups to have a more focused discussion. Participants can move between the rooms, and moderators can monitor the discussions in each room. This feature can be particularly helpful for online classes or virtual team meetings.</p>

<p><b>Question Bonus. </b><b>Bonus [ðŸ’Ž+1]</b> Minimum 3 accessibility improvements for both considered applications. These improvements should take into consideration the existing accessibility features and improve upon them. </p>
<p><b>Answer Bonus. </b>Minimum 3 accessibility improvements for Google Meet. These improvements should take into consideration the existing accessibility features and improve upon them. 

    Here are three accessibility improvements that can be made to Google Meet, building upon the existing accessibility features:
    
    Improved Closed Captioning: Google Meet currently provides closed captioning for accessibility purposes. However, the captions are not always accurate, and they may not be visible to all participants. Improvements can be made by allowing participants to adjust the size, font, and color of the captions for their individual preferences. Additionally, automatic speech recognition technology can be utilized to provide more accurate captions.
    
    Keyboard Navigation: Google Meet currently allows for keyboard navigation, which is essential for individuals who use assistive technologies such as screen readers or magnifiers. However, the keyboard navigation can be improved by providing a clear and logical order of focus on various elements of the interface, including buttons, menus, and controls. This can be achieved by following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards for keyboard accessibility.
    
    Color Contrast: Google Meet's current color scheme may not be accessible for individuals with low vision or color blindness. Improvements can be made by increasing the contrast ratio between foreground and background colors, providing alternative text for images, and using clear and easy-to-read fonts. Additionally, a high-contrast mode can be provided for individuals who require it.
    
    Overall, these accessibility improvements can make Google Meet more inclusive and accessible for users with diverse needs. By implementing these changes, Google Meet can provide a better experience for all participants, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.</p>

<p>To work on the challenge, each member of the team chose a remote communication application, which was answered by going through all the questions. Thus: Hriscu Alexandru-Gabriel chose Google Meet; Anton Cosmin chose Microsoft Teams. For mobilization, the entire activity took place with the help of the Github platform on a repository where both team members worked. Both at the end and along the way, there were debates among the team members related to improvements or sharing of ideas based on the questions and answers. Everything took place through constant communication and understanding between the team members.</p>
<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Following the previously presented, we can see the differences between the two remote communication applications (Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) based on the knowledge gained in the HCI laboratories and courses, we can have a better overview of what HCI means due to the application of the theory on this challenge and we can observe the weak points, the strong points and future ideas that can improve the applications.</p>
