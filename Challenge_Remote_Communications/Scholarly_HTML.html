<h2>3. Introduction</h2>
<p>This report will present the progress of the "Remote Communications" challenge, carried out by the students Hriscu Alexandru-Gabriel and Cosmin Anton, during the second semester of the academic year 2022-2023, Faculty of Informatics Iasi. This report presents the answers to the problems presented previously for the following two remote communication applications: Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. </p>
<h2>4. Remote communication application - Google Meet</h2>
<p><b>Question 1. </b>Observe the existing affordances, visual variables and interaction flows for a given use case â€“ for example, delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at late hours â€“ and propose better approaches (if any).</p>
<p><b>Answer 1. </b>Let's examine the scenario where one needs to give an academic presentation or attend a meeting during late hours using Google Meet. This entails taking into account the current capabilities, visual elements, and methods of interaction available:</p>
<ol> 
     <li>One of the features offered by Google Meet is the ability to share one's screen during a presentation or meeting. This function is made possible through an affordance provided by Google Meet. The visual cue used for this feature is a green icon with an upward arrow that can be found at the bottom of the screen. To initiate screen sharing, the presenter clicks on the icon and selects the desired screen to share, which follows a specific interaction flow.</li>
     <li>Google Meet offers the option of a chat function, which permits attendees to communicate with one another during a presentation or meeting. This feature is made possible through an affordance provided by Google Meet. The visual indicator for this function is a speech bubble icon situated at the bottom of the screen. To initiate the chat, a participant clicks on the icon and composes their message, following a specific interaction flow.</li>
     <li>One of the features offered by Google Meet is the capability to record presentations or meetings. This function is enabled by an affordance provided by Google Meet. The visual cue used for this feature is a red icon with a circle, situated at the bottom of the screen. To start recording, the presenter clicks on the icon and selects the appropriate option, following a specific interaction flow.</li>
</ol>
    <p>Alternative approaches that may be more effective are suggested:</p>
   <ol>  
     <li>Although screen sharing is a valuable feature, it could be enhanced by offering presenters the ability to select which specific application or window they wish to share, rather than their entire screen. This could be accomplished by providing a dropdown menu that displays a list of presently open applications/windows, from which the presenter can select the one they want to share.</li>
     <li>The chat feature could be enhanced by offering the ability to send private messages to particular participants, rather than only being able to send messages to the entire group. This could be accomplished by allowing a participant to click on the name of the person they want to message, which would then open a private chat window.</li>
     <li>Although recording is a helpful feature, it could be enhanced by offering the option to automatically transcribe the recording. This could be accomplished by using AI technology to transcribe the audio from the recording and generate a text-based version of the presentation or meeting.</li>
  </ol>  
    <p>Overall, by implementing these suggested improvements, Google Meet can improve the user experience for individuals who need to give academic presentations or attend meetings during late hours.</p>

<p><b>Question 2. </b>Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest the similar ones for a text-only interaction (see CLI â€“ Command Line Interface).</p>
<p><b>Answer 2. </b>Google Meet heavily utilizes visual metaphors and idioms to communicate information and functionality to users. For instance, recognizable and intuitive visual metaphors like the "hand raise" icon or the "mute/unmute" button are commonly used. However, in instances of text-only interactions, like a Command Line Interface (CLI), visual metaphors and idioms are not suitable. Rather, text-based idioms and language are used to express commands and functionality.</p>
    <p>Below are examples of visual metaphors and idioms used in Google Meet, alongside comparable ones that can be utilized in a CLI environment:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>
	<ul>
	<li>Visual Metaphor: Hand raise icon</li>
    <li>Text-based Idiom: "Request permission to speak"</li>
    <li>In a CLI, a user can use a command such as "request permission to speak" to indicate they want to speak or ask a question. This can be achieved by implementing a feature that allows users to "raise their hand" using a specific command or keyword.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<br>
    <li>
	<ul>
	<li>Visual Metaphor: Mute/unmute button</li>
   <li>Text-based Idiom: "Toggle mute on/off" </li>
    <li>In a CLI, a user can use a command such as "toggle mute on/off" to mute or unmute their microphone. This can be achieved by implementing a feature that allows users to use a specific command or keyword to mute or unmute their microphone.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<ul>
    <li>Visual Metaphor: Share screen icon</li>
    <li>Text-based Idiom: "Share screen with remote participants"</li>
    <li>In a CLI, a user can use a command such as "share screen with remote participants" to share their screen during a call. This can be achieved by implementing a feature that allows users to use a specific command or keyword to share their screen with other participants.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
  </ol>
    <p>Although visual metaphors and idioms may not be relevant in a text-only interface, such as a CLI, text-based idioms and language can be utilized to communicate commands and functionality similarly. By incorporating features that enable users to employ particular commands or keywords, a CLI can be as user-friendly and straightforward to use as a visual interface like Google Meet.</p>

<p><b>Question 3. </b>Discuss the cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts.</p>
<p><b>Answer 3. </b>Cognitive overload arises when an individual's working memory is overburdened with excessive information or numerous tasks, resulting in decreased performance and heightened stress levels. Concerning Google Meet, cognitive overload can manifest in several circumstances, such as:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In meetings with a significant number of participants, attendees may encounter difficulty in monitoring multiple speakers and discussions simultaneously. This can result in cognitive overload as the brain endeavors to process and retain all the information.</li>
    <li>While on a Google Meet call, participants may also engage in multitasking, such as checking emails or working on other assignments while simultaneously attending the call. This can result in cognitive overload as the brain endeavors to transition between various tasks, resulting in reduced performance across all tasks.</li>
    <li>Technical difficulties, such as inadequate network connectivity or video/audio issues, can also contribute to cognitive overload as participants may experience difficulties in hearing or seeing what is happening in the call, leading to an escalation in stress levels.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To alleviate cognitive overload in the aforementioned contexts, Google Meet can implement several measures, including:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>To lessen cognitive overload in large group meetings, Google Meet can implement measures such as limiting the number of participants in a call or introducing features like breakout rooms that enable smaller group discussions.</li>
    <li>Encouraging attentional focus: Google Meet can help reduce cognitive overload caused by multitasking by promoting the need for participants to focus their attention solely on the meeting. Google Meet can provide guidance on best practices and give reminders to turn off distractions such as notifications or other tabs.</li>
    <li>To prevent cognitive overload caused by technical difficulties, Google Meet can provide technical support to participants. This can include guidance on improving network connectivity or troubleshooting common video/audio issues. This can help to ensure that participants can fully engage with the call and reduce the stress caused by technical difficulties.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In special conditions or contexts, reducing cognitive overload can enhance the user experience and boost productivity during Google Meet calls.</p>
<p><b>Question 4. </b>List minimum three improvements that can be made to optimize these applications from the point of view of the main audience on at least two platforms â€“ for instance, Web + mobile native, desktop native + mobile native. Each improvement will be listed in pairs: UI/UX problem identified & solution suggested.</p>
<p><b>Answer 4. </b>Three ways to enhance the user experience on Google Meet for the main audience on both platforms are:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>
	<ul>
    <li>Web + Mobile Native:</li>
    <li>UI/UX Problem: Confusion and frustration for users can be caused by inconsistent user interface and functionality across different devices and platforms.</li>
    <li>Solution: To avoid confusion and frustration for users, it is important to design a uniform user interface and functionality that is consistent across all devices and platforms. This means that users should be able to easily navigate the platform, with the same features and functionalities available on all devices and platforms. Having a consistent design will ensure that users can switch between devices without any difficulties and use the platform seamlessly.</li>
        </ul>
	</li>
	<br>
    <li>
	<ul>
	<li>Desktop Native + Mobile Native:</li>
    <li>UI/UX Problem: Managing multiple participants during a video call can be particularly challenging on mobile devices with smaller screens.</li>
    <li>Solution: Managing multiple participants during a video call can be challenging, particularly on mobile devices with smaller screens. To address this, Google Meet could introduce a new feature that enables users to easily manage participants on both desktop and mobile devices. This feature should include functions such as muting participants, enabling and disabling video, and removing participants. It could also include a moderator-controlled feature that allows the moderator to manage the call from their device while enabling participants to view and listen on their own devices.</li>
        </ul>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<ul>
	<li>Web + Mobile Native:</li>
    <li>UI/UX Problem: The user experience can be negatively affected, and effective communication can be hindered during a call due to low-quality audio and video.</li>
    <li>Solution: To enhance the user experience during video calls, it is important to address poor video and audio quality issues. This can be achieved by implementing measures to optimize the compression algorithms for video and audio, improving network connectivity, and offering the option to adjust the video and audio quality based on network conditions. To supplement this, Google Meet can also provide guidance on how to improve the video and audio quality for its users by suggesting the use of headphones and offering tips on network connectivity.</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
  </ol>
<p><b>Question 5. </b>How the empiric laws (Fittsâ€™, Hickâ€™s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device interaction?</p>
<p><b>Answer 5. </b>The empirical laws of Fitts', Hick's, and Steering can be re-evaluated and modified to apply to the context of multi-device interaction in Google Meet in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Fitts' Law: In the context of multi-device interaction, Fitts' Law can be modified to consider the variations in the size and position of targets across different devices. As an example, if a user is simultaneously using a laptop and a smartphone during a Google Meet call, the targets (such as buttons or links) on each device will be different in terms of size and position. To address this, the user interface can be designed to optimize the placement of targets on each device based on its screen size and orientation.</li>
    <li>Hick's Law: Hick's Law suggests that the time taken to make a decision increases as the number of choices increases. In the context of multi-device interaction, this can be adapted to consider the number of devices being used at the same time. If a user is using multiple devices during a Google Meet call, they may need to switch between devices to perform different tasks. To reduce decision-making time, the user interface can be designed to provide simple and intuitive navigation between devices.</li>
    <li>Steering Law: The Steering Law postulates that the time required to move a pointer to a target is proportional to the angle between the pointer and the target. In the context of multi-device interaction in Google Meet, this law can be adapted to consider the different angles and orientations of various devices. For instance, a user may need to adjust their movements to match the angle of the device they are currently using. To address this issue, the user interface can be designed to provide seamless and consistent navigation between devices, regardless of their orientation, to optimize the time required to move the pointer to a target.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Question 6. </b>List three new features that can be added to improve the experience and sketch those new features on paper and/or digitally.</p>
<p><b>Answer 6. </b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Virtual Backgrounds: A suggested improvement for Google Meet would be the addition of a feature that allows users to alter their background to a virtual image or video during a video call. This capability has become increasingly popular in other video conferencing applications, and could help to safeguard users' privacy by concealing their physical location. Additionally, it could add a lighthearted aspect to video calls.</li>
    <li>Live Polls: By adding live polls during a Google Meet call, participants can be engaged and their feedback can be gathered effectively. Live polls can be used for conducting surveys, gathering opinions on various topics discussed during the call, and providing real-time results, which can aid in decision-making processes.</li>
    <li>Breakout Rooms: One improvement that can enhance Google Meet's functionality is to introduce the option of creating breakout rooms during a video call. This feature is beneficial for group discussions where participants can be divided into smaller groups to have a more focused conversation. With the ability to move between rooms, moderators can oversee the discussions in each breakout room. This feature can be especially valuable for virtual team meetings or online classes.</li>

<p><b>Question Bonus. </b><b>Bonus [ðŸ’Ž+1]</b> Minimum 3 accessibility improvements for both considered applications. These improvements should take into consideration the existing accessibility features and improve upon them. </p>
<p><b>Answer Bonus. </b>Minimum 3 accessibility improvements for Google Meet. These improvements should take into consideration the existing accessibility features and improve upon them. </p>
    <p>Below are three enhancements that can improve the accessibility of Google Meet by building on the current accessibility features:</p>
 <ol>
	<li>Improved Closed Captioning: Although Google Meet offers closed captioning to enhance accessibility, there is room for improvement. Some issues include the accuracy of the captions and visibility for all participants. One potential solution is to provide participants with the ability to customize their captions' font, size, and color to suit their individual needs. Another solution is to use automatic speech recognition technology to improve the accuracy of the captions.</li>
    <li>Keyboard Navigation: Google Meet's keyboard navigation feature can be further enhanced to improve accessibility for individuals who use assistive technologies. This can be achieved by ensuring a logical order of focus on different elements of the interface, such as buttons, menus, and controls. The interface should follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure that the keyboard navigation is consistent and easy to use. This will enable individuals with disabilities to participate more effectively in Google Meet meetings.</li>
    <li>Color Contrast: To enhance accessibility, Google Meet could improve its color scheme for individuals with low vision or color blindness. One way to do this is to increase the contrast ratio between foreground and background colors to make it easier to distinguish elements. Providing alternative text for images and using clear and easy-to-read fonts can also help. Moreover, Google Meet can introduce a high-contrast mode that makes it easier for individuals with low vision to see the interface.</li>
</ol>   
   <p>Overall, these accessibility improvements can make Google Meet more inclusive and accessible for users with diverse needs. By implementing these changes, Google Meet can provide a better experience for all participants, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.</p>

<p>To work on the challenge, each member of the team chose a remote communication application, which was answered by going through all the questions. Thus: Hriscu Alexandru-Gabriel chose Google Meet; Anton Cosmin chose Microsoft Teams. For mobilization, the entire activity took place with the help of the Github platform on a repository where both team members worked. Both at the end and along the way, there were debates among the team members related to improvements or sharing of ideas based on the questions and answers. Everything took place through constant communication and understanding between the team members.</p>
<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Following the previously presented, we can see the differences between the two remote communication applications (Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) based on the knowledge gained in the HCI laboratories and courses, we can have a better overview of what HCI means due to the application of the theory on this challenge and we can observe the weak points, the strong points and future ideas that can improve the applications.</p>
