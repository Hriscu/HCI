By employing this pattern, we have provided users with a convenient and quick way to stay connected to the app even when they don't have access to their phones.

We have employed this pattern to merge the real world with virtual elements, offering users a broader perspective and enabling them to make more informed decisions during matches.

By leveraging voice assistants, users can control various app functionalities without relying solely on the visual interface. We have opted for this pattern to add an extra level of convenience and accessibility, enabling users to interact with the app naturally and effortlessly.
5. Conversational Patterns: We have implemented Conversational Patterns to create an interactive and personalized experience for users. This involves the use of conversations or chatbots to guide users through different functionalities and respond to their queries or requests. We have integrated these patterns to offer users a conversational experience similar to interacting with a personal assistant. This pattern facilitates navigation and interaction within the app, providing quick responses, relevant information, and personalization based on users' needs and preferences.
