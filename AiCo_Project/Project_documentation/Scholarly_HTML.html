<h2 id="Introduction">3. Introduction</h2>
<p>During the second semester of the academic year 2022-2023 at the Faculty of Informatics Iasi, the Airsoft Companion project was successfully completed with contributions from Hriscu Alexandru-Gabriel, Anton Cosmin, and Bobu Dragoș. This section serves as an introduction to the project, providing an overview of its objectives and scope.</p>
<p>The Airsoft Companion project aimed to design and develop a mobile application specifically tailored for airsoft enthusiasts. The application aimed to enhance the airsoft gaming experience by providing features such as team management, equipment customization, match scheduling, and communication tools.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of the project, various design and development tasks were undertaken. This included creating personas to understand the target audience and their needs, developing storyboards to visualize user interactions, designing user flows to define the navigation paths within the application, and creating sitemaps to outline the application's structure.</p>
<p>Sketches were also produced to ideate and explore different design concepts, while typography choices were carefully considered to ensure optimal readability and visual appeal. Color schemes were selected to create a cohesive and visually pleasing aesthetic, and contrast checkers were used to ensure accessibility for all users.</p>
<p>Wireframes were created to establish the layout and structure of the application's screens, and prototypes were developed to provide an interactive experience for user testing and feedback gathering. The design process also took into account affective factors and emotions to create an engaging and immersive experience for the users.</p>
<p>The use of design patterns, such as smartwatch patterns and conversational patterns, further enhanced the functionality and usability of the application across different platforms and interaction modes.</p>
<p>The subsequent sections of this report will delve into the specific aspects of the project, including personas, storyboards, user flows, sitemaps, sketches, typography, color schemes, contrast checkers, wireframes, prototypes, affective factors & emotion, design patterns for web/desktop/mobile, smartwatch patterns, conversational patterns, voice patterns, AR/VR patterns, video demonstration, team members, conclusion, and references. Each section will provide detailed insights and findings related to the respective topic.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Affective-emotion">16. Affective factors & emotion</h2>
<p>Affective factors & emotion play a crucial role in designing a user-centered experience for the Airsoft application. We have carefully considered these factors throughout the design process to create a more engaging and satisfying user experience.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have incorporated appropriate color schemes and typography choices that align with the emotional tone we want to evoke. The color scheme we selected consists of vibrant and energetic colors, such as #FF0000 (red), #0080FF (blue), and #00FF80 (emerald green), which are known to stimulate excitement and enthusiasm among users. These colors are strategically used to create a sense of adrenaline and intensity, reflecting the spirit of the Airsoft experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have paid attention to the use of visual elements and graphics that evoke emotions related to teamwork, competition, and thrill. The wireframes and prototypes include dynamic imagery showcasing players in action, capturing the excitement and camaraderie of the Airsoft gameplay. Additionally, the user flow incorporates elements that promote a sense of achievement and progress, such as progress indicators and rewards, to heighten the emotional engagement of the users.</p>
<p>In terms of interaction design, we have focused on providing responsive and intuitive feedback to user actions. For example, when a user successfully completes a task or achieves a milestone, the application responds with celebratory animations or positive messages, reinforcing a sense of accomplishment and boosting user satisfaction. Conversely, when errors occur, clear error messages are displayed along with helpful instructions, ensuring that users feel supported and guided throughout their journey.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have taken into consideration the emotional impact of microinteractions. Smooth transitions, subtle animations, and haptic feedback have been incorporated to provide a delightful and immersive experience, creating a positive emotional connection between the user and the application.</p>
<p>Overall, by considering affective factors and emotions, we have strived to create an Airsoft application that not only meets functional requirements but also elicits an emotional response from users, enhancing their overall satisfaction and enjoyment.
